## WooCommerce Core

### Bug Fixes

#### Rename the Centered Header Menu with Search to Centered Header Menu. [11637](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11637)

1. Create a new page or post.
2. Confirm that the `Centered Header Menu` pattern appears under the WooCommerce category dropdown and is NOT named `Centered Header Menu with Search`.
3. Insert in and confirm everything appears as expected.

#### Fix decoding issue and pattern. [11681](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce-blocks/pull/11681)

1. Ensure you are on fresh install (it should not have the `patterns_ai_data` post created).
2. Insert the `Featured Products: Fresh & Tasty` pattern and make sure it has all the default text content, nothing is empty.
3. Insert a few other WooCommerce Blocks patterns and check all of them have all the text content as well.
